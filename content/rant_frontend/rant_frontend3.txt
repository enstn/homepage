Congrats. You have now created a website. It's that easy.

Well, almost. There are quite a few times when the LLM might get stuck, and you have to bias your prompt towards specific coding concepts you know would solve the problem. 
The quality of code therefore directly corresponds to the depth of your own knowledge base. Additionally, LLMs tend to return quite average-performing and prompt-specific code, 
so you'll have to rewrite a lot if you want to keep the codebase clean and somewhat general for future extensions. <br> <br>

I guess this is where it could get difficult for complete non-coders... Reddit / Stackoverflow are generally your best shots here. The probability that some random guy
already had the same idea and issue as you is almost certain. You'll find a solution. And if not - a tiny bit of code literacy isn't too bad to possess nowadays, if you ask me.
<br> <br>

Of course, if you don't care about optimal performance or readable code, prompting will suffice. Follow the steps above and publish your website onto github pages. That's it. Now go build something üêå
