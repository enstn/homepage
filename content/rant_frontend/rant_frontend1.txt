Frontend is dead. Take this website as an example. The frontend you're staring at right now is almost entirely made by ClaudeAI.
Want to build something like this? Easy peasy üçã squeezy. Check this out: <br> <br>

Do you have internet? Do you have an okay-ish LLM like ChatGPT at hand? Can you stop scrolling through brainrot for like an hour? Good, that's it. You don't need more. <br> <br>

How did I arrive at this conclusion? Well, in hindsight of my own website developement, the majority of my mental effort was poured into UI logic, page setup & all sorts of error handling while
the majority of time was wasted on formatting the frontend styling across different browsers. Given how advanced LLMs nowadays are, you can easily off-load both the logic implementation and the 
design realization. Especially the later part. <br> <br>

I wont deny this tho: knowing general code syntax and having basic coding experience will significantly speed up your workflow.
Debugging & feature implementation is 100% easier for someone who is familiar with coding procedures.
Still, the fact remains: you could code this website without any prior coding knowledge. <br> <br>

Thanks to that, you can solely focus on designing your content.
Here is a crude step-by-step on how I would do it ( if I were to start again without any coding experience ):
