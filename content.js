                        So, dear reader, I invite you to join me. <br> <br>
                        
                        This will be our technological crusade against the universe's cruel refusal to gift humanity with magic.
                        For this might be our most promising shot yet towards archieving man-made telepathy without touching a wand. <br> <br>

			            Let me set the stage before we head straight in. My university mandates students to attend so-called P&S's (Praktikum & Seminare). By doing so, the all-mighty education system hopes to bestow hands-on-experience upon our

                        Most P&S time-bounds simply don't allow the teachers to go beyond the surface. And most students don't venture beyond the shown surface. <br> <br>

			            Therefore, P&S naturally turns into a game of min-maxing credit-efficiency. You have the grand choice between the following:

                        Jokes aside, I'm no better. Almost all of my previous P&S were selected based on credit-efficiency with a slight interest in the covered topics.

                        research fields - you'll find amazing professors and PhDs welcoming our combined single-digit IQ.

                        A late-night research session, an extra question after class or even paper request followed by a teacher's response is not nearly as magical as a letter from Hogwarts, but it sure is mighty.
                        After all, you just gained a kind-hearted opportunity to learn from the wizards of the 21st century. Why wield wooden sticks if you can wield science? <br> <br>
