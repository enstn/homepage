                        So I invite you to join me, dear reader. This will be our technological crusade against the universe's cruel refusal to gift humanity with magic.
                        This might be our most promising shot yet for archieving man-made telepathy without touching a scalpel. <br> <br>

			            Let me set the stage before we head straight in. My university mandates students to attend so-called P&S's. Basically, you visit a "lab" 
				        for one entire semester (most probably a painfully plain classroom). By doing so, the all-mighty education system hopes to bestow hands-on-experience upon our 
			            little peasant brains. Sure enough, three hours on a random Tuesday afternoon will definitely grant <span class=\"text-italic\">profound</span> insights into the technological 
			            battlefront spearheaded by generations of homo sapiens. Obviously. Not. You dimwit. <br> <br>

			            Naturally, P&S thus turns into a game of min-maxing credit-efficiency. You have the grand choice between:

                        P&S time-bounds simply don't allow the teachers to go beyond the surface. And most students don't venture beyond the shown surface. I'm guilty as well, I'm trying to change.
